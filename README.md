# Better 1:1s with journalism-inspired interview techniques

Regular 1:1 meetings are foundational for many managers — the bedrock from which they build trust and communication with their team, and a critical tool in effectively leading. And yet, while we see a mountain of evidence indicating how effective 1:1s are, many managers still struggle to make their 1:1s anything more than a cursory status check.

They may need better interviewing techniques.

As a young journalist working at daily newspapers I learned interview techniques early on that continue to be useful today in my 1:1s. Journalists have honed these interview techniques for decades for one simple reason: they’re effective tools to get people to open up and share context with you.

So let’s talk about what makes a good interview: it’s not the Q&A. That’s a format, not what makes an interview useful or successful. Plenty of great interviews have been sparked by a single question. What makes interviews great are active listening, thoughtful follow-ups and an easy, conversational feel.

A story is only as useful and interesting as the interviews that led to it. Same with your 1:1 and the relationship resulting from it. The output depends on the input. So if you want to get more out of your 1:1, you’re going to have to dive a bit deeper into what makes people open up. Here are some tips:

**Don’t make it a status update.**
You should already know “who”, “what” and “when”. Project management software exists solely to tell you who, what and when, and you have plenty of other resources to tell you what’s going on. What you want to get at is “why” and “how”. You want context. The inside scoop. 

You want to hear about the problems, the challenges, the petty grievances and workarounds that people are struggling with as they work on the things the project management software is tracking. And asking them for an update when their status is already readily available to you is a waste of their time. Don’t waste people’s time.

**Build the relationship.**
Every journalist knows if you want a great source, you’ve got to cultivate it. You have to build a relationship. If you have a shared interest or connection that may be a starting point. No matter what, building a relationship isn’t just a cursory exchanging of pleasantries as the meeting starts —it’s you working to build trust and a connection. Don’t skimp on this part. 

Make sure you’ve done your homework, too. If they’ve written a personal README, have you read it? Keep notes if you need to, but you need to keep track of who they are and what they care about. You can’t build the relationship if you’re not willing to put in the effort to get to know them and their work.

**You can force people to give you their time, but their conversation is a gift.**
Oftentimes, people talk to journalists because they pretty much have to: Their role or position dictates that they are obligated to talk to the press. That doesn’t mean they actually want to talk to you. When you acknowledge that requesting their time does not equate to receiving their thoughts, then you can see the gap you have to bridge in order to receive the gift of their thoughts.

**Be genuinely curious.**
You’re not just asking questions so you can check them off your list. You’re trying to learn something. What is it? Be curious. Be interested. Be concerned, if need be. Follow-up. Gain more understanding. Whatever you do, don’t just go through the motions. That’s not how you learn.

**Venue is important.**
Think about when you’re setting your 1:1 time and location, and make it convenient, safe and relevant to the other person. You want them to open up and share context, so go meet them on their terrain. They’ll be more comfortable, and they’ll have more interesting things at hand to show and tell you.

**Know what you want out of the conversation ahead of time.**
What is it you want to know? Do you know? You should. Have you heard whispers of some team dynamic problems? Are you concerned about burnout? 

You should already be thinking about what you want to get out of the 1:1 and have questions and notes prepared beforehand.

**Remember your questions aren’t the important part.**
You know those questions and notes you prepared ahead of time? Great, now be ready to throw them aside if the story they’re telling you is more interesting than the one you had in mind beforehand. Practice active listening and pay particular attention to the intriguing threads you hadn’t seen or heard before. Pull on those threads, even if it means you might not get to all of your prepared questions. Remember, listening is the important part.

**Think about flow.**
As you juggle the questions you wanted to ask and the threads you want to follow, think about the flow of the conversation. You want your partner in this conversation to feel comfortable opening up to you, and rat-a-tat peppering them with questions is unlikely to achieve that. So you have to find a way of actively listening while simultaneously working through a rapidly-changing array of potential next questions. 

This is a hard skill and it takes work, but when you have flow, you make it all look easy. The conversation is natural and fluid. Think about how you might segue from one topic to the next, or how you might naturally circle back to a prior thread you’d like to examine a bit more.

**Ask open-ended questions.**
Questions with simple one-word answers are death to an interview, and they’re not going to take you anyplace interesting in a 1:1, either. Ask open-ended questions and see where the conversation goes. Again, you need to listen to the responses and pay attention to flow, but the open-ended question lets your conversation partner open up new topics you may be surprised by.

**Take notes. Not too many.**
You’re probably taking notes so you can keep track of what was discussed and so you have a reference for topics you’d like to revisit later. Good notes can be a goldmine, but don’t try to record everything. A lot of it just won’t matter, and meticulously recording every syllable will just get in the way of your active listening and conversational flow. 

Instead, focus on noting highlights, memorable quotes, and topics that feel unfinished (you’ll probably want to come back to them someday). Get those right and leave the chatter behind. It’s not important and gets in the way.

**If it’s not clear why something is important to them, ask.**
“Why is this important to you” is a great question to prompt useful quotes. As a manager, it’s also a great question to surface useful context. Especially when you’re not sure why it’s so important to them.

**Embrace the silence.**
One of the oldest tricks in the journalist toolkit is letting their interview subject squirm under the weight of a heavy pause until they can’t help themselves and just start talking. In some cases this can be a useful technique for you, too, but be cautious about using it. You can’t make your conversation partner squirm too much or too often before they stop wanting to talk to you. But used appropriately and sparingly it’s hugely effective at getting past a canned response and on to what someone really thinks.

**Regurgitate.**
Another technique for pulling more info out of people is to more or less repeat what they just said: “So, you’re saying…“. Most people can’t help but add more context to clarify.

**Watch for excitement.**
You’ll see moments where people become excited. They’re more animated. They’ll talk faster. They’ll lean forward. They’re engaged. Watch for these moments and seize them. What is it that’s so exciting? They want to talk about it, so let them.

**Circle back.**
If you think there’s more to a thread, come back to it. If you feel resistance -- maybe they feel they’ve already said too much -- you could push, but it’s often better to let it go and come back to it later. And, in some cases, come back to it again. Give space, but come back to it again until you feel like you have a good understanding.

**Be relaxed.**
If you want to put your 1:1 at ease, you have to be easy yourself. Since people have a tendency to mirror the behavior they see in others, especially when there’s a power imbalance, any nervousness or rigidity on your part will be doubled. But if you’re relaxed, open and conversational, that’s the tone you’ve set for them to mirror.

**Do not cancel.**
If you’re taking your 1:1s seriously, you already know this, but it’s true in interviews, too, and it bears repeating. If you cancel, you tell your 1:1, or your interview subject, that while they had a brief window to tell you what’s on their mind, that wasn’t all that important to you. Next time, they’re going to be less likely to give you their time and thoughts as willingly. 

Ironically, as you get better at flow and your 1:1s feel more conversational, it may feel easier to cancel them. “We’re just chatting”, you’ll tell yourself. And when you do, you deprive yourself of all that context and juicy useful information you’ve so carefully cultivating. Meanwhile, you’re also sending a message that the meeting — that 1:1 time — isn’t valuable. Don’t do that. The other things can wait, as a manager or as a journalist, gathering facts and context takes precedence.
